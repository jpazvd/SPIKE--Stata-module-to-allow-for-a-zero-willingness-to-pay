# SPIKE: Stata module to allow for a zero willingness to pay

## Description

    spike command allows for a non-zero probability of zero willingness-to-pay in referendum-style
    contingent valuation experiments as suggested by Kristrom (1997). This property is particular
    usefull in experiments in which a large fraction of the population chose not to consume good
    being offered. In such circunstances the use of traditional parametric models based on probit
    and logit models are likelly to predict a negative willingness-to-pay.
